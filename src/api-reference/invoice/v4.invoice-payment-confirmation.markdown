# Invoice Payment Confirmation v4  <a name="invoice-payment-confirmation"></a>

This API gives clients and partners the ability to retrieve and update invoice payment data between the SAP Concur platform and a client’s external financial system. Information for new and historical invoice payments processed through an Invoice Pay feature can be retrieved for posting to a client’s external financial system. Invoices paid through an external system and not by an Invoice Pay feature can be updated with payment information from the external system.

## Limitations <a name="limitations"></a>

This API is only available for direct integrations with an existing Concur Invoice client. Clients developing their own integrations between the Concur platform and their external system must purchase Client Web Services to utilize this API. Partner applications must complete the certification process to utilize the API scopes. This API supports only JSON. Access to this documentation does not provide access to the API.

## Scope Usage <a name="scope-usage"></a>

Name|Description|Endpoint
---|---|---
`invoice.paymentconfirmation.write`|Write access to update payment status and write access to fetch new payments. |POST, BULK, POST
`invoice.paymentconfirmation.read`|Read access to retrieved payments. |GET

## Dependencies <a name="dependencies"></a>

None.

## Access Token Usage <a name="access-token-usage"></a>

This API supports only Company access tokens.

## Retrieve New Invoice Payments <a name="retrieve-new-payment"></a>

Use this endpoint to retrieve information for new invoice payments processed through an Invoice Pay feature and have not been extracted (by the Invoice Payment Confirmation Extract job or this API). A maximum of 500 records can be returned at a time. To ensure all payments are retrieved, call this API until you receive an empty payment in the response. After new invoice payments are retrieved, they will automatically be updated as extracted and cannot be retrieved again with this endpoint or the extract job. Retrieving new invoice payments is a POST call because the invoice payments must be updated to extracted.

# API Release Notes, October 2025

## New This Month

### Now Available: Hotel Service v4 New Callback URL

The Change Notification API does not currently provide a way for the hotel connector to know which datacenter to use for the given booking. To resolve this we are adding a callback url to the Hotel Service v4 Reservation request (along with the trip/booking IDs that we are already adding today) based on whatever datacenter the service is running in. 
 
New element added to the ReservationCriteria:

```
"hrefs": {
     "changeNotificationV4": "https://us2.api.concursolutions.com/travel/v4/trips/{TRIP_ID}/hotels/change-notification",
     "authV0": "https://us2.api.concursolutions.com/oauth2/v0/token"
}
 ```

Note that {TRIP_ID} in above endpoint will be substituted with actual Trip ID used for the booking.

### Now Available: Hotel Service v4 New Accepted Payments Response Field

A new field has been added to Hotel Service v4 Search response to allow suppliers to send us accepted payments. This will be used to populate a filter on the Search results page so that the user can filter for hotels that accept American Express, for example.
 
Accepted Payments should be an array of strings:

``` 
"acceptedPayments": [
  "AMERICAN EXPRESS"
]
```

### Preview: Digital Certificates to be Transitioned to DigiCert Global Root G2 and G3 Authorities

The following change applies to the **Concur Cloud for Public Sector** data center: To maintain compliance with evolving security standards and ensure uninterrupted compatibility with Mozilla-based browsers, SAP Concur is transitioning our digital certificates to the following updated DigiCert Global Root G2 and G3 authorities:

* DigiCert Global Root G2 – for RSA-based certificates
* DigiCert Global Root G3 – for ECDSA-based certificates

Adopting the new root certificates is critical to avoid potential trust errors or connection issues when accessing our services via Mozilla browsers.

>**Note**: This proactive update follows DigiCert’s announcement regarding Mozilla’s planned deprecation of the DigiCert Global Root CA.

* Information First Published: October 10, 2025
* Applies to: All Products

>**Note**: Certificate pinning is not recommended. To maintain compliance with evolving security standards, SAP Concur renews certificates on a regular basis. Pinned certificates are **not** updated automatically and failure to manually update them before the implementation date might cause service disruptions.

>**Note**: SAP ICS customers who follow the certificate handling processes described in the following note do not need to take any action: [2914977 - FAQ: Concur Certificates, Authentication, and Connectivity](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CONCUR/c5d6d15e7ecb4b4d8238b383d59ac2f4/1164714ddbd044c5aeca870bbc4e4a3a.html).

### Updated Preview: New Client SSL Certificate for ESS webhook.api.concursolutions.com

**Overview**

In an effort to ensure the ongoing security of our products and services, on October 22, 2025, ESS will be issuing a new webhook.api.concursolutions.com SSL certificate. We will always use the same client [x509](/api-reference/ess/2026.webhook.api.concursolutions.com.pem) certificate. The common name is C=DE, ST=Baden-Württemberg, L=Walldorf, O=SAP SE, CN=webhook.api.concursolutions.com.

Please note that this year not just the certificate will be reissued, but also the location, country, and organization in the certificate metadata is changing to SAP. 

Make sure you visit our [Troubleshooting](/api-reference/ess/v4.event-subscription.html#ess-troubleshooting) section in the Event Subscription Service v4 documentation.

### Deprecation: Locations v3 API

### Preview: Public Certificate Root Change

To maintain compliance with evolving security standards and ensure uninterrupted compatibility with Mozilla-based browsers, we are transitioning our digital certificates to the updated DigiCert Global Root G2 and G3 authorities:

* DigiCert Global Root G2 – for RSA-based certificates

* DigiCert Global Root G3 – for ECDSA-based certificates

This proactive update follows DigiCert’s announcement regarding Mozilla’s planned deprecation of the DigiCert Global Root CA.

Adopting the new root certificates is critical to avoid potential trust errors or connection issues when accessing our services via Mozilla browsers.

Target Implementation Dates:

Certificate|Implementation Date

*.api.concurcdc.cn|Oct 9, 2025
*.concursolutions.com|Oct 23, 2025

Clients who have not pinned the certificate do not need to take any action as the new certificate will automatically be updated when it becomes available. 

#### RECOMMENDATION – Please Read Carefully

**Certificate pinning is not recommended.**

While it may add a layer of control, pinning certificates introduces risks. Certificates used by SAP Concur are renewed on a regular basis. Pinned certificates are not updated automatically and may cause service disruptions if not updated before implementation date.

#### FOR SAP ICS Customers

Please refer to section 2 “**Which SSL certificates do I need to have installed**” of [2914977 - FAQ: Concur Certificates, Authentication, and Connectivity](https://me.sap.com/notes/2914977) for detailed instructions.

#### ACTION REQUIRED

If your systems **pin** the root or intermediate certificate, you must update your trust store to include the following certificates:

**RSA Certificates Download Links**

* Intermediate: [DigiCert Global G2 TLS RSA SHA256 2020 CA1](https://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertGlobalG2TLSRSASHA2562020CA1-1.crt.pem?_gl=1*i7c9wi*_gcl_au*MTI2NjY3MzYyMC4xNzMyNTAwNTAw)

> Note: Most modern systems now prefer **ECDSA** for connections, while **RSA** is still used primarily by legacy systems. To ensure full compatibility, please ensure that your systems trust both **ECDSA and RSA certificates**.
